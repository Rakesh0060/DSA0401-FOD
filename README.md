31.Scenario: You work as a data scientist for an e-commerce company that sells a wide range of  products online. The company collects vast amounts of data about its customers, including their  purchase history, browsing behavior, demographics, and more. The marketing team wants to  understand their customer base better and improve their targeted marketing strategies. They have  asked you to perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques to identify distinct groups  of customers with similar characteristics.  
Question: Your task is to use Python and clustering algorithms to segment the customers into  different groups based on their behavior and characteristics. The marketing team will use these  segments to tailor their marketing campaigns and promotions effectively. 
32. Scenario: You work as a data scientist for a real estate company. The company has collected  data on various houses, including features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms,  location, and other relevant attributes. The marketing team wants to build a predictive model to  estimate the price of houses based on their features. They believe that linear regression modeling  can be an effective approach for this task.  
Question:Your task is write a Python program to perform bivariate analysis and build a linear  regression model to predict house prices based on a selected feature (e.g., house size) from the  dataset. Additionally, you need to evaluate the model's performance to ensure its accuracy and  reliability.  
3. Scenario: You work as a data scientist for an automobile company that sells various car  models. The company has collected data on different car attributes, such as engine size,  horsepower, fuel efficiency, and more, along with their corresponding prices. The marketing team  wants to build a predictive model to estimate the price of cars based on their features.  
Question: Your task is write a Python program that perform linear regression modeling to predict  car prices based on a selected set of features from the dataset. Additionally, you need to evaluate  the model's performance and provide insights to the marketing team to understand the most  influential factors affecting car prices.
